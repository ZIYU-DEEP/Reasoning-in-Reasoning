    "You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover. \n",
    "Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.\n",
    "I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3, and there have been some syntax changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.\n",
    "- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`. \n",
    "  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.\n",
    "- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`. The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.\n",
    "- We now enter tactic mode using the `by` keyword. The syntax `begin... end` will not work.\n",
    "- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics are separated by a newline. \n",
    "    For example, we could write.\n",
    "    ```lean\n",
    "    theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by\n",
    "      apply And.intro hp\n",
    "      exact And.intro hq hp\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one. \n",
    "  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.\n",
    "- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching. \n",
    "    For example, in Lean 4 we can write\n",
    "    ```lean\n",
    "    theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by\n",
    "      induction n with\n",
    "      | zero => rfl\n",
    "      | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.\n",
    "- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching. For example, in Lean 4 we can write\n",
    "```lean\n",
    "example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by\n",
    "  intro h\n",
    "  cases h with\n",

    "The following is a description of some commonly used tactics. \n",
    "Of course, feel free to use tactics outside of this list. \n",
    "Remember that it is good style to use high-level automations like `simp` and `ring` instead of manually performing low-level manipulations. \n",
    "- `abel`: reduces expressions in additive, commutative monoids/groups to a normal form. \n",
    "- `apply`: the tactic `apply e` matches the current goal against the conclusion of `e`. If it succeeds, the new goal states are the premises of `e`.\n",
    "- `continuity`: attempts to prove goals of the form `continuous f` by applying lemmas tagged with the `continuity` attribute. \n",
    "- `contrapose`: transforms the goal into its contrapositive.\n",
    "- `convert`: The tactic `convert e` is similar to `refine e`, except the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the goal. Any rewrites required to transform `e` into the goal become the new goal state.\n",
    "- `group`: normalizes expressions in multiplicative groups, without assuming commutativity.\n",
    "- `have`: `have h : t := p` adds the hypothesis `h : t` to the current goal. If you want to prove `h` in tactic mode, use the syntax `have h : t := by --tactic proof goes here`. \n",
    "- `linarith`: proves any goal that consists of linear arithemtic.\n",
    "- `nlinarith`: version of `linarith` that can tolerate some nonlinearity.\n",
    "- `norm_num`: normalizes numerical expressions.\n",
    "- `polyrith`: proves polynomial equalities.\n",
    "- `push_neg`: pushes negations through quantifiers.\n",
    "- `simp`: uses lemmas and hypotheses tagged with the `simp` attribute to simplify the goal. Use `simp [h1, h2,..., hn]` to add `h1, h2,..., hn` to the list of lemmas used by simp.\n",
    "- `ring`: tactic for solving goals involving expressions in commutative rings and normalizing expressions in commutative rings.\n",

      "\n",
      "For $k$ from 5 to 12, $k^2$ is greater than 16, so $z^{k^2}$ is not a 12th root of unity. However, because $z^{k^2}$ is a 48th root of unity, we can pair up the terms in the sum such that each pair sums to 0. Specifically, we pair up $z^{k^2}$ and $z^{(12-k)^2}$, which are complex conjugates of each other. Therefore, the sum of $z^{k^2}$ for $k$ from 5 to 12 is also 0.\n",

      "1. Here is a plan for the formal proof:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - We first note that the complex number `z` is a 4th root of unity, so `z^(k^2)` is a 48th root of unity for `k` in `{1, 2, ..., 12}`.\n",
      "   - We then split the sum `∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, z^(k^2)` into two parts: one for `k` from 1 to 4, and one for `k` from 5 to 12.\n",
      "   - For `k` from 1 to 4, `k^2` is less than or equal to 16, so `z^(k^2)` is a 12th root of unity. Therefore, the sum of `z^(k^2)` for `k` from 1 to 4 is 0. We can use the `split` tactic to separate these cases.\n",
      "   - For `k` from 5 to 12, `k^2` is greater than 16, so `z^(k^2)` is not a 12th root of unity. However, because `z^(k^2)` is a 48th root of unity, we can pair up the terms in the sum such that each pair sums to 0. Specifically, we pair up `z^(k^2)` and `z^(12-k)^2`, which are complex conjugates of each other. Therefore, the sum of `z^(k^2)` for `k` from 5 to 12 is also 0.\n",
      "   - We can then apply the same reasoning to the sum `∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, 1 / z^(k^2)`. Therefore, both sums are 0, and their product is 0.\n",
      "   - Finally, we need to show that 0 equals 36, which is a contradiction. We can use the `contradiction` tactic to finish the proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The next step in the proof is to split the sum into two parts, one for `k` from 1 to 4, and one for `k` from 5 to 12. We can use the `split` tactic to do this. However, Lean does not support splitting sums directly. Instead, we need to rewrite the sum as the sum of two sums: one over the interval `[1, 4]` and one over the interval `[5, 12]`. We can achieve this using the `rw` tactic and the `sum_Icc_eq_sum_Icc` lemma from the `BigOperators` library.\n",
