1. Establish Sufficiency: Simplify the problem by focusing on the relationship between the absolute value and its argument. The `suffices` tactic may be used to show that proving `abs (x - 2) = -(x - 2)` is sufficient.
2. Rewrite and Simplify: Apply the `rw` tactic to substitute the given condition `abs (x - 2) = p` into the sufficiency condition, simplifying the equation to relate directly to `p`.
3. Linear Arithmetic: Employ the `linarith` tactic to handle the linear arithmetic implications of the simplified equation, facilitating the deduction of the relationship between `x`, `p`, and their coefficients.
4. Apply Absolute Value Property: Utilize `apply abs_of_neg` to justify the sufficiency condition by demonstrating that `x - 2` is indeed negative (as `x < 2`), which aligns with the property of the absolute value of a negative number being its negation.
5. Conclude with Linear Arithmetic: Re-employ `linarith` to finalize the proof, leveraging the established relationships and properties to conclude `x - p = 2 - 2 * p`.

1. Establish Sufficiency: Simplify the problem by focusing on the relationship between the absolute value and its argument. The `suffices` tactic may be used to show that proving `abs (x - 2) = -(x - 2)` is sufficient.
2. Rewrite and Simplify: Apply the `rw` tactic to substitute the given condition `abs (x - 2) = p` into the sufficiency condition, simplifying the equation to relate directly to `p`.
3. Linear Arithmetic: Employ the `linarith` tactic to handle the linear arithmetic implications of the simplified equation, facilitating the deduction of the relationship between `x`, `p`, and their coefficients.
4. Apply Absolute Value Property: Utilize `apply abs_of_neg` to justify the sufficiency condition by demonstrating that `x - 2` is indeed negative (as `x < 2`), which aligns with the property of the absolute value of a negative number being its negation.
5. Conclude with Linear Arithmetic: Re-employ `linarith` to finalize the proof, leveraging the established relationships and properties to conclude `x - p = 2 - 2 * p`.
