======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.81
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.8
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.73
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.85
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.84
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.77
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.69
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.05
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.88
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.81
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.73
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.03
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.0
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.77
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.69
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.0
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.97
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.95
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.64
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.97
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.94
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.92
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.9
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.55
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.92
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.9
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.88
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.53
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.53
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.88
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.86
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.52
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.52
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.52
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.84
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Understand the Properties of Divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number relates to the prime factorization of that number. The formula for the number of divisors is derived from the exponents in the prime factorization.
2. Analyze Given Conditions: Use the given conditions on the number of divisors for `2n` and `3n` to infer the prime factorization structure of `n`, `2n`, and `3n`.
3. Prime Factorization of `6n`: Combine the inferred prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`. This involves understanding how multiplying by `2` and `3` alters the exponents in the prime factorization.
4. Calculate Divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor formula to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the number of divisors. This step requires careful consideration of how the exponents in the prime factorization of `6n` differ from those in `2n` and `3n`.
5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of `6n` to conclude that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, often denoted as $\tau(n)$ or $d(n)$, has specific properties when dealing with multiples. The prime factorization of $n$ plays a crucial role in determining the number of divisors.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$. Since $2n$ and $3n$ share the factor $n$, their prime factorizations will help in deducing the prime factorization of $6n$.
3. Use Given Divisor Counts: The given counts of divisors for $2n$ and $3n$ imply specific structures for their prime factorizations. For example, if a number has 28 divisors, its prime factorization can inform us about the powers of primes involved.
4. Calculate Prime Factorization of $6n$: Combine the insights from the prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$. This step might involve considering the least common multiple and its properties.
5. Apply Divisor Function Formula: Use the formula for the divisor function, which, for a number $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, gives the number of divisors as $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\cdots(a_k + 1)$. Apply this formula to the prime factorization of $6n$.
6. Conclude with the Desired Divisor Count: After applying the divisor function formula to $6n$, conclude that the number of divisors is 35, as required. This step consolidates the prime factorization analysis and the application of the divisor function formula.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Understand the Problem: Recognize that the number of positive divisors of an integer relates to the prime factorization of that integer. The problem suggests a relationship between the divisors of $2n$, $3n$, and $6n$.
2. Prime Factorization: Analyze the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ to infer the possible prime factorization of $n$. This step involves understanding how the multiplication by 2 and 3 affects the prime factorization and, consequently, the number of divisors.
3. Calculate Divisors of $6n$: Use the inferred prime factorization of $n$ to deduce the prime factorization of $6n$ by incorporating the effects of multiplying $n$ by 6. This step requires understanding how the exponents in the prime factorization relate to the number of divisors.
4. Apply Divisor Function Property: Employ the property of the divisor function, which states that the number of positive divisors of a number is the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization.
5. Derive and Prove the Result: From the prime factorization of $6n$, calculate the number of positive divisors using the divisor function property. This involves arithmetic calculations based on the exponents in the prime factorization.
6. Conclude with the Desired Result: Conclude that the number of positive divisors of $6n$ is 35, based on the calculations and properties applied in the previous steps.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors function, usually denoted as `σ₀(n)`, has specific properties when dealing with prime factorization. This is crucial since the problem involves the divisors of multiples of `n`.
2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorization of `2n` and `3n`. Given the number of divisors, infer the possible structure of `n`'s prime factorization. This step involves understanding that the formula for the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.
3. Combine Factorizations: Determine the structure of the prime factorization of `6n` by combining the insights from the factorizations of `2n` and `3n`. This includes recognizing that `6n` incorporates the prime factors of both `2n` and `3n`.
4. Calculate Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function formula to the inferred prime factorization of `6n`. This involves recognizing that the number of divisors is the product of one plus each of the exponents in the prime factorization.
5. Conclude with Specific Value: Utilize the calculated structure of `6n`'s prime factorization to deduce that `6n` has exactly 35 divisors, concluding the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Multiply the equation by \(xy\): Start by multiplying both sides of the equation \(x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}\) by \(xy\) to eliminate the fractions and to make the equation polynomial.
2. Rearrange and simplify: After multiplication, rearrange the terms to bring all terms to one side of the equation, aiming to form a quadratic equation in terms of \(xy\).
3. Factor the resulting equation: Look for a way to factor the resulting polynomial equation, which should reveal a product of terms involving \(xy\).
4. Solve for \(xy\): Use the factored form of the equation to solve for \(xy\), taking into account the conditions \(x \neq 0\), \(y \neq 0\), and \(x \neq y\).
5. Conclude \(xy = 2\): After solving the equation, deduce that \(xy = 2\) based on the given conditions and the simplified equation.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.73
1. Multiply both sides of the equation by \(x \cdot y\): This step aims to eliminate the fractions and produce a quadratic equation in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). The `ring` tactic can be used to simplify the resulting algebraic expressions.
2. Rearrange the equation: After multiplying, we aim to bring all terms to one side to form a recognizable quadratic equation. This can be achieved through algebraic manipulation, possibly using the `linarith` or `ring` tactics for simplification.
3. Recognize a factorable quadratic equation: The resulting equation should be factorable, revealing a product of terms that includes \(x \cdot y - 2\) as a factor.
4. Factor and solve for \(x \cdot y\): By factoring the quadratic equation, we can isolate \(x \cdot y - 2 = 0\), thereby directly solving for \(x \cdot y\).
5. Conclude \(x \cdot y = 2\): Finally, from the factored equation, deduce that \(x \cdot y\) must equal 2, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.69
1. Multiply both sides of the equation by $x*y$: This step will eliminate the fractions, leading to a polynomial equation. This can be achieved using the `apply` tactic to apply a lemma that justifies this operation.
2. Expand and simplify the resulting equation: After multiplying, expand the terms to get a simpler polynomial equation. This simplification can be done using the `ring` tactic, which handles expressions in commutative rings.
3. Rearrange the equation to a recognizable form: The goal is to manipulate the equation into a form that reveals the product $xy$. This might involve moving terms from one side of the equation to the other and factoring. The `rw` tactic can be used for rewriting the equation in the desired form.
4. Apply the condition that $x \neq y$: This condition implies that the solution cannot be symmetric in $x$ and $y$, thus helping to eliminate potential solutions that do not satisfy $x \neq y$. The `contrapose` tactic can be useful here to work with this non-equality condition.
5. Conclude that $xy = 2$: After simplification and applying all conditions, use `linarith` or direct application of lemmas to conclude that the only solution under the given conditions is $xy = 2$.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.67
1. Multiply the given equation by \(x \cdot y\): This step aims to eliminate the fractions and obtain a quadratic equation in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). This manipulation will result in an equation that is more straightforward to analyze.
2. Apply the distributive property: After multiplying, distribute the terms to get a clearer view of the resulting polynomial equation. This step simplifies the equation and makes the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) more apparent.
3. Rearrange the equation: Aim to express the equation in a standard quadratic form or in a form that reveals the product \(xy\). This rearrangement is crucial for identifying the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) that the problem statement hints at.
4. Apply known algebraic identities or factor: If the equation resembles a recognizable algebraic form, apply the relevant identities or factor the equation. This step might directly reveal the value of \(xy\) or simplify the path towards it.
5. Use the given conditions to solve for \(xy\): Given that \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct and nonzero, use these conditions along with the simplified or factored equation to deduce the value of \(xy\). This step involves logical deduction based on the constraints provided by the problem.
6. Conclude that \(x \cdot y = 2\): After the algebraic manipulation and logical deduction, assert the conclusion that the product of \(x\) and \(y\) equals 2, as indicated by the problem statement. This final step resolves the problem by leveraging the derived equation and the given conditions.

1. Multiply the equation by \(xy\): Start by multiplying both sides of the equation \(x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}\) by \(xy\) to eliminate the fractions and to make the equation polynomial.
2. Rearrange and simplify: After multiplication, rearrange the terms to bring all terms to one side of the equation, aiming to form a quadratic equation in terms of \(xy\).
3. Factor the resulting equation: Look for a way to factor the resulting polynomial equation, which should reveal a product of terms involving \(xy\).
4. Solve for \(xy\): Use the factored form of the equation to solve for \(xy\), taking into account the conditions \(x \neq 0\), \(y \neq 0\), and \(x \neq y\).
5. Conclude \(xy = 2\): After solving the equation, deduce that \(xy = 2\) based on the given conditions and the simplified equation.

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by \(x \cdot y\): This step aims to eliminate the fractions and produce a quadratic equation in terms of \(x\) and \(y\). The `ring` tactic can be used to simplify the resulting algebraic expressions.
2. Rearrange the equation: After multiplying, we aim to bring all terms to one side to form a recognizable quadratic equation. This can be achieved through algebraic manipulation, possibly using the `linarith` or `ring` tactics for simplification.
3. Recognize a factorable quadratic equation: The resulting equation should be factorable, revealing a product of terms that includes \(x \cdot y - 2\) as a factor.
4. Factor and solve for \(x \cdot y\): By factoring the quadratic equation, we can isolate \(x \cdot y - 2 = 0\), thereby directly solving for \(x \cdot y\).
5. Conclude \(x \cdot y = 2\): Finally, from the factored equation, deduce that \(x \cdot y\) must equal 2, completing the proof.

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by $x*y$: This step will eliminate the fractions, leading to a polynomial equation. This can be achieved using the `apply` tactic to apply a lemma that justifies this operation.
2. Expand and simplify the resulting equation: After multiplying, expand the terms to get a simpler polynomial equation. This simplification can be done using the `ring` tactic, which handles expressions in commutative rings.
3. Rearrange the equation to a recognizable form: The goal is to manipulate the equation into a form that reveals the product $xy$. This might involve moving terms from one side of the equation to the other and factoring. The `rw` tactic can be used for rewriting the equation in the desired form.
4. Apply the condition that $x \neq y$: This condition implies that the solution cannot be symmetric in $x$ and $y$, thus helping to eliminate potential solutions that do not satisfy $x \neq y$. The `contrapose` tactic can be useful here to work with this non-equality condition.
5. Conclude that $xy = 2$: After simplification and applying all conditions, use `linarith` or direct application of lemmas to conclude that the only solution under the given conditions is $xy = 2$.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Calculate the value of `n`: Determine the set of integers `m` in the range `1` to `7` (inclusive) for which the greatest common divisor of `m` and `8` is `1`. This can be done by enumerating the possibilities and applying the definition of the greatest common divisor.
2. Identify the pattern in powers of `3` modulo `8`: Observe the pattern that emerges when calculating `3^k % 8` for successive values of `k`. This step involves recognizing that the powers of `3` modulo `8` cycle in a predictable manner.
3. Relate `n` to the cycle of powers of `3` modulo `8`: Use the calculated value of `n` from step 1 to determine the specific position within the cycle of powers of `3` modulo `8`. This involves understanding how the number of integers with `gcd(m, 8) = 1` influences the exponent of `3`.
4. Apply modular arithmetic to conclude `3^n % 8 = 1`: Finally, leverage the observed pattern and the specific value of `n` to assert that `3^n % 8` must equal `1`, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Calculate the Set: Determine the set of integers \(m\) in the range \(1 \le m \le 7\) (not \(1 \le m \le 8\) as stated, because 8 would not satisfy the gcd condition) for which \(\gcd(m, 8) = 1\). This step involves understanding the properties of gcd and how they interact with the specific modulus 8.
2. Count Elements: Count the number of elements in this set. This will directly give us the value of \(n\), as \(n\) is defined to be the cardinality of this set.
3. Relate to Power of 3: Analyze the cyclicity of \(3^k \mod 8\) for \(k \ge 0\). This involves recognizing that powers of 3 modulo 8 exhibit a repeating pattern.
4. Match \(n\) with Cycle: Match the calculated value of \(n\) to its corresponding value in the cycle of \(3^k \mod 8\). This step requires understanding how the exponent \(n\) influences the remainder when \(3^n\) is divided by 8.
5. Conclude the Proof: Conclude that \(3^n \mod 8 = 1\) based on the cyclical pattern identified in the previous steps and the specific value of \(n\) obtained from the cardinality of the set. This will involve either direct calculation or application of known results about the cyclicity of modular exponentiation.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Calculate the cardinality: Determine the set of numbers from 1 to 7 that are coprime with 8. This can be done by evaluating the gcd condition given in the hypothesis.
2. Identify the numbers: Realize that the numbers in the range 1 to 7 that are coprime with 8 are precisely those that are odd, as 8 is a power of 2 and thus only shares common divisors with even numbers.
3. Count the numbers: Count the number of odd numbers in the range 1 to 7, which directly gives the value of `n`.
4. Apply Euler's theorem or direct computation: Recognize that raising 3 to any power and then taking the modulus 8 results in a cycle. Specifically, `3^1 % 8 = 3`, `3^2 % 8 = 1`, and so on in a cycle of length 2 for odd exponents.
5. Conclude with specific cases: Since `n` is the count of odd numbers from 1 to 7, it is fixed. Calculate `3^n % 8` directly or use the cyclic property identified to conclude that the remainder is 1.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Calculate the Set: Determine the set of numbers between 1 and 7 inclusive that are coprime with 8, using the given condition on `Nat.gcd`.
2. Count the Set: Calculate the cardinality of this set to find `n`.
3. Identify Pattern: Recognize the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 8, which cycles through a predictable sequence.
4. Apply the Pattern: Use the calculated value of `n` to determine the specific value in the cycle of powers of 3 modulo 8.
5. Conclude with Modular Arithmetic: Conclude that `3^n % 8 = 1` based on the identified pattern and the calculated value of `n`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Simplify the given equation: Recognize that \(2^3\) is a constant value (8) and rewrite the equation as \(4^b + 8 = 12\).
2. Subtract 8 from both sides: Simplify the equation to \(4^b = 4\) by subtracting 8 from both sides, which can be done using `linarith` or directly simplifying.
3. Recognize the base equality: Observe that \(4^b = 4^1\), indicating that the bases are equal and thus the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold.
4. Conclude \(b = 1\): Since the bases are the same and \(4^b = 4^1\), use simple reasoning or `linarith` to conclude that \(b = 1\).

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Rewrite the equation: Use the given condition to rewrite the equation in terms of known values, recognizing that \(2^3 = 8\).
2. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to \(4^b + 8 = 12\).
3. Subtract 8 from both sides: Use linear arithmetic to show that subtracting 8 from both sides yields \(4^b = 4\).
4. Apply logarithmic properties: Recognize that \(4^b = 4\) implies \(b = 1\) due to the properties of exponents.
5. Conclude with the value of \(b\): Use `exact` to assert the conclusion that \(b = 1\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Simplify the equation: Recognize that `2 ^ 3` is a constant value (`8`), and rewrite the equation as `4 ^ b + 8 = 12`.
2. Subtract constant terms: Use linear arithmetic to simplify the equation to `4 ^ b = 4`.
3. Recognize the base equality: Note that `4` can be written as `4 ^ 1`, which suggests that `b` must be `1` for the equality to hold.
4. Conclude with direct substitution: Use the recognition from the previous step to directly substitute and conclude that `b = 1`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.7
1. Simplify the given equation: Recognize that `2 ^ 3` is a constant value (8) and can be simplified directly in the equation.
2. Substitute and simplify: Use the `norm_num` tactic to perform arithmetic simplification, including the calculation of `2 ^ 3 = 8`.
3. Rearrange the equation: Isolate the term involving `b` (`4 ^ b`) on one side of the equation to facilitate solving for `b`.
4. Solve for `b`: Recognize that `4 ^ b = 4` to satisfy the equation, given the simplification from the previous steps.
5. Apply logarithmic properties: Since `4 = 4 ^ 1`, conclude that `b = 1` by equating the exponents, using properties of exponents and logarithms implicitly.
6. Conclude with direct equality: Use the `exact` tactic to assert the final conclusion `b = 1` based on the algebraic manipulation and properties applied.

Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.
6. Conclude with the Lower Bound: Conclude that `4 / 5` is the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies the conditions given, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.75
1. Assume a solution exists: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as per the problem statement. This assumption is crucial for the subsequent steps.
2. Vieta's formulas application: Consider applying Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots, particularly focusing on the sum and product of roots, even though the direct application might not yield immediate results due to the equation's structure.
3. Symmetry and substitution: Notice the symmetry in the polynomial equation and consider making a substitution that simplifies this symmetry, such as `y = x + 1/x`. This step reduces the quartic equation to a quadratic in terms of `y`, making it easier to analyze.
4. Derive a new equation: Derive a new equation in terms of `y` and analyze its discriminant. The discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions to exist, which imposes conditions on `a` and `b`.
5. Relate discriminant to `a^2 + b^2`: Express the condition for a non-negative discriminant in terms of `a^2 + b^2`. This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly completing the square.
6. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the condition derived from the discriminant to find the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2`. This step likely involves some optimization argument or direct computation.
7. Conclude with the minimum value: Conclude that the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` is `4/5`, based on the analysis and conditions derived in the previous steps.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.74
1. Utilize the Existence of a Solution: Begin by acknowledging the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation. This existence implies certain properties about the coefficients `a` and `b` that can be explored.
2. Construct a New Equation: Consider creating a new equation by evaluating the given polynomial at specific values of `x` or manipulating the equation to make it more amenable to analysis. This might involve squaring the equation, considering the equation at `-x`, or other algebraic manipulations that relate `a` and `b` to the roots.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.67
1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.78
1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.
6. Conclude with the Lower Bound: Conclude that `4 / 5` is the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies the conditions given, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.71
1. Assume a solution exists: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as per the problem statement. This assumption is crucial for the subsequent steps.
2. Vieta's formulas application: Consider applying Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots, particularly focusing on the sum and product of roots, even though the direct application might not yield immediate results due to the equation's structure.
3. Symmetry and substitution: Notice the symmetry in the polynomial equation and consider making a substitution that simplifies this symmetry, such as `y = x + 1/x`. This step reduces the quartic equation to a quadratic in terms of `y`, making it easier to analyze.
4. Derive a new equation: Derive a new equation in terms of `y` and analyze its discriminant. The discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions to exist, which imposes conditions on `a` and `b`.
5. Relate discriminant to `a^2 + b^2`: Express the condition for a non-negative discriminant in terms of `a^2 + b^2`. This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly completing the square.
6. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the condition derived from the discriminant to find the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2`. This step likely involves some optimization argument or direct computation.
7. Conclude with the minimum value: Conclude that the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` is `4/5`, based on the analysis and conditions derived in the previous steps.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.69
1. Utilize the Existence of a Solution: Begin by acknowledging the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation. This existence implies certain properties about the coefficients `a` and `b` that can be explored.
2. Construct a New Equation: Consider creating a new equation by evaluating the given polynomial at specific values of `x` or manipulating the equation to make it more amenable to analysis. This might involve squaring the equation, considering the equation at `-x`, or other algebraic manipulations that relate `a` and `b` to the roots.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.54
1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.

3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.93
1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.
6. Conclude with the Lower Bound: Conclude that `4 / 5` is the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies the conditions given, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.88
1. Assume a solution exists: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as per the problem statement. This assumption is crucial for the subsequent steps.
2. Vieta's formulas application: Consider applying Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots, particularly focusing on the sum and product of roots, even though the direct application might not yield immediate results due to the equation's structure.
3. Symmetry and substitution: Notice the symmetry in the polynomial equation and consider making a substitution that simplifies this symmetry, such as `y = x + 1/x`. This step reduces the quartic equation to a quadratic in terms of `y`, making it easier to analyze.
4. Derive a new equation: Derive a new equation in terms of `y` and analyze its discriminant. The discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions to exist, which imposes conditions on `a` and `b`.
5. Relate discriminant to `a^2 + b^2`: Express the condition for a non-negative discriminant in terms of `a^2 + b^2`. This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly completing the square.
6. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the condition derived from the discriminant to find the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2`. This step likely involves some optimization argument or direct computation.
7. Conclude with the minimum value: Conclude that the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` is `4/5`, based on the analysis and conditions derived in the previous steps.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.89
1. Utilize the Existence of a Solution: Begin by acknowledging the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation. This existence implies certain properties about the coefficients `a` and `b` that can be explored.
2. Construct a New Equation: Consider creating a new equation by evaluating the given polynomial at specific values of `x` or manipulating the equation to make it more amenable to analysis. This might involve squaring the equation, considering the equation at `-x`, or other algebraic manipulations that relate `a` and `b` to the roots.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.82
1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.
6. Conclude with the Lower Bound: Conclude that `4 / 5` is the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies the conditions given, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.84
1. Assume a solution exists: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as per the problem statement. This assumption is crucial for the subsequent steps.
2. Vieta's formulas application: Consider applying Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots, particularly focusing on the sum and product of roots, even though the direct application might not yield immediate results due to the equation's structure.
3. Symmetry and substitution: Notice the symmetry in the polynomial equation and consider making a substitution that simplifies this symmetry, such as `y = x + 1/x`. This step reduces the quartic equation to a quadratic in terms of `y`, making it easier to analyze.
4. Derive a new equation: Derive a new equation in terms of `y` and analyze its discriminant. The discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions to exist, which imposes conditions on `a` and `b`.
5. Relate discriminant to `a^2 + b^2`: Express the condition for a non-negative discriminant in terms of `a^2 + b^2`. This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly completing the square.
6. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the condition derived from the discriminant to find the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2`. This step likely involves some optimization argument or direct computation.
7. Conclude with the minimum value: Conclude that the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` is `4/5`, based on the analysis and conditions derived in the previous steps.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Utilize the Existence of a Solution: Begin by acknowledging the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation. This existence implies certain properties about the coefficients `a` and `b` that can be explored.
2. Construct a New Equation: Consider creating a new equation by evaluating the given polynomial at specific values of `x` or manipulating the equation to make it more amenable to analysis. This might involve squaring the equation, considering the equation at `-x`, or other algebraic manipulations that relate `a` and `b` to the roots.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.78
1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Assume Existence: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as stated in the hypothesis.
2. Polynomial Manipulation: Manipulate the given polynomial equation to express it in a form that facilitates the application of Vieta's formulas or another method to relate the coefficients `a` and `b` to the roots of the polynomial.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Use Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step may require considering the sum and product of the roots or their powers.
4. Inequality Derivation: Derive an inequality involving `a` and `b` by applying algebraic manipulations and inequalities (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to the expressions obtained from Vieta's formulas.
5. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the derived inequality to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This may involve optimizing the expressions involving `a` and `b` to find the minimum value that satisfies the inequality for all real solutions `x`.
6. Conclude with the Lower Bound: Conclude that `4 / 5` is the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies the conditions given, completing the proof.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.49
1. Assume a solution exists: Begin by assuming the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation, as per the problem statement. This assumption is crucial for the subsequent steps.
2. Vieta's formulas application: Consider applying Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the roots, particularly focusing on the sum and product of roots, even though the direct application might not yield immediate results due to the equation's structure.
3. Symmetry and substitution: Notice the symmetry in the polynomial equation and consider making a substitution that simplifies this symmetry, such as `y = x + 1/x`. This step reduces the quartic equation to a quadratic in terms of `y`, making it easier to analyze.
4. Derive a new equation: Derive a new equation in terms of `y` and analyze its discriminant. The discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions to exist, which imposes conditions on `a` and `b`.
5. Relate discriminant to `a^2 + b^2`: Express the condition for a non-negative discriminant in terms of `a^2 + b^2`. This involves algebraic manipulation and possibly completing the square.
6. Minimize `a^2 + b^2`: Use the condition derived from the discriminant to find the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2`. This step likely involves some optimization argument or direct computation.
7. Conclude with the minimum value: Conclude that the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` is `4/5`, based on the analysis and conditions derived in the previous steps.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.49
1. Utilize the Existence of a Solution: Begin by acknowledging the existence of a real solution `x` to the given polynomial equation. This existence implies certain properties about the coefficients `a` and `b` that can be explored.
2. Construct a New Equation: Consider creating a new equation by evaluating the given polynomial at specific values of `x` or manipulating the equation to make it more amenable to analysis. This might involve squaring the equation, considering the equation at `-x`, or other algebraic manipulations that relate `a` and `b` to the roots.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: If the manipulation of the original equation yields a polynomial equation, use Vieta's formulas to relate the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients `a` and `b`. This can help establish inequalities or relationships involving `a` and `b`.
4. Analyze the Coefficients: Through the manipulation and potential application of Vieta's formulas, derive inequalities involving `a` and `b`. These inequalities are likely to stem from the properties of the polynomial's roots (e.g., their sum, product) and how they relate to `a` and `b`.
5. Employ Inequality Techniques: Use classical inequality techniques (e.g., AM-GM inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) to relate the derived inequalities to `a^2 + b^2`. The goal is to establish a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2` that holds under the given conditions.
6. Conclude with the Minimum Value: After establishing inequalities involving `a` and `b`, deduce the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` that satisfies all conditions. This step may involve solving a system of inequalities or optimizing a function of `a` and `b`.
7. Justify the Bound is Achievable: Finally, provide a justification or example that demonstrates the lower bound of `4 / 5` for `a^2 + b^2` is achievable, ensuring the bound is not only theoretical but also practical within the constraints of the problem.

1. Introduce the Existence: Begin by acknowledging the existence of at least one real solution to the given polynomial equation. This step involves taking the given existential statement and considering the implications of a specific `x` satisfying the equation.
2. Construct a Related Expression: Formulate an expression or a set of expressions that relate to the given polynomial, potentially involving `a`, `b`, and the roots of the polynomial. This may involve squaring or other operations to eliminate the root variable and highlight the relationship between `a` and `b`.
3. Apply Vieta's Formulas: Utilize Vieta's formulas to express `a` and `b` in terms of the roots of the polynomial. This step is crucial for relating the coefficients to the roots and eventually to the sum of squares of the coefficients.
4. Analyze the Minimum Value: Through algebraic manipulation and possibly the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, analyze the expressions involving `a` and `b` to deduce a lower bound for `a^2 + b^2`. This step may involve recognizing patterns or inequalities that relate to the sum of squares.
5. Conclude with Inequality: Employ an inequality, such as the AM-GM inequality or a specific lemma related to polynomials, to establish the minimum value of `a^2 + b^2` as `4/5`. This involves synthesizing the relationships and inequalities derived in the previous steps to make a final conclusion about the minimum value.

1. Case Analysis: Split the proof into cases based on the residue of `a` modulo 3, i.e., `a % 3 = 0`, `a % 3 = 1`, or `a % 3 = 2`. This is because any integer must fall into one of these categories when divided by 3.
2. Apply Modular Arithmetic: In each case, calculate `a ^ 2 % 3` explicitly. Use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expressions.
3. Case 1 (`a % 3 = 0`): Show that if `a` is divisible by 3, then `a ^ 2` is also divisible by 3, leading to `a ^ 2 % 3 = 0`.
4. Case 2 (`a % 3 = 1`): Show that if `a % 3 = 1`, then `a ^ 2 % 3` simplifies to `1`, using the fact that `(1 ^ 2) % 3 = 1`.
5. Case 3 (`a % 3 = 2`): Show that if `a % 3 = 2`, then `a ^ 2 % 3` simplifies to `1`, using the fact that `(2 ^ 2) % 3 = 1`.
6. Conclude: Combine the results from the three cases to conclude that for any integer `a`, `a ^ 2 % 3` is either `0` or `1`.

1. Case Analysis: Perform a case analysis on `a mod 3`. Since any integer `a` modulo 3 can be either 0, 1, or 2, we will consider these three cases separately.
2. Case 1 (`a mod 3 = 0`): Use the property of modular arithmetic to show that if `a mod 3 = 0`, then `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 0`. This can be done by noting that `a` is divisible by 3, and thus `a ^ 2` is also divisible by 3.
3. Case 2 (`a mod 3 = 1`): Similarly, show that if `a mod 3 = 1`, then `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 1`. This follows from the property that squaring a number that is congruent to 1 modulo 3 will result in a number that is also congruent to 1 modulo 3.
4. Case 3 (`a mod 3 = 2`): Show that if `a mod 3 = 2`, then `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 1`. This can be demonstrated by recognizing that a number congruent to 2 modulo 3, when squared, is congruent to 4 modulo 3, which simplifies to 1.

4. Case 3 (`a mod 3 = 2`): For `a mod 3 = 2`, square `a` and demonstrate that `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 1`. This case may require more intricate algebraic steps, possibly including the substitution of `2` with `-1` modulo `3` to facilitate simplification.

2. Case 1 (`a mod 3 = 0`): For `a mod 3 = 0`, square `a` and apply the definition of modulus to show that `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 0`. This may involve simplifying expressions and using properties of modulus.
3. Case 2 (`a mod 3 = 1`): For `a mod 3 = 1`, similarly square `a` and show that `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 1`. This will likely involve algebraic manipulation and application of the modulus operation.
4. Case 3 (`a mod 3 = 2`): For `a mod 3 = 2`, square `a` and demonstrate that `(a ^ 2) mod 3 = 1`. This case may require more intricate algebraic steps, possibly including the substitution of `2` with `-1` modulo `3` to facilitate simplification.
5. Conclusion: Conclude that for all cases, `a ^ 2 mod 3` is either `0` or `1`, completing the proof.

1. Case Analysis on `a mod 3`: Begin by considering the possible remainders when `a` is divided by `3`, which are `0`, `1`, or `2`. This can be done using the `cases` tactic with `a % 3`.
2. Square Each Case: For each case of `a mod 3`, square `a` to obtain `a^2`. This step involves straightforward arithmetic.
3. Apply Modulo Arithmetic: For each squared value, calculate `a^2 % 3` to obtain the remainder when divided by `3`. Use `norm_num` to simplify the calculations.
4. Conclude with Or Introduction: For each case, show that `a^2 % 3 = 0` or `a^2 % 3 = 1`. Use `Or.inl` for cases where the result is `0` and `Or.inr` for cases where the result is `1`.
5. Combine Cases: Use the results from each case to conclude that for any integer `a`, `a^2 % 3 = 0` or `a^2 % 3 = 1`. This may involve the use of `or.intro_left` or `or.intro_right` tactics to combine the cases into a single conclusion.

3. Integer Denominator Implication: Since `(x^2 + y^2).den = 1` implies that `x^2 + y^2` is an integer, deduce that the sum of their squares has a denominator of 1.
4. Common Denominator Requirement: Infer that for the sum of two rational squares to have a denominator of 1, the individual squares must share a common denominator.
5. Conclude Equality of Denominators: Conclude that `x.den` must equal `y.den` based on the requirement that their squares contribute to a sum with a denominator of 1, leveraging properties of rational numbers and their operations.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Analyze the structure of rational numbers: Recognize that a rational number can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. This understanding is crucial for manipulating the expressions involving `x` and `y`.
2. Express `x` and `y` in terms of their numerators and denominators: Use the property that any rational number `q` can be expressed as `q.num / q.den`, where `q.num` is the numerator and `q.den` is the denominator.
3. Expand and simplify the given condition: Expand `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` using the representation of `x` and `y` as fractions. This involves squaring the fractions and adding them, leading to a common denominator expression.
4. Utilize properties of rational numbers: Apply properties of rational numbers and their operations to deduce that for the denominator of the sum of two squared rational numbers to be `1`, certain conditions must be met by the denominators of the individual numbers.
5. Prove equality of denominators: Show that for the denominator of the sum `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` to be `1`, the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal. This may involve showing that any common factors in the denominators must be present in both `x` and `y` to avoid increasing the denominator of the sum beyond `1`.
6. Conclude with the equality of denominators: Deduce that since the denominator of `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` is `1`, and based on the properties of rational numbers and the manipulation of the expression, it follows that `x.den = y.den`.

2. Simplify Given Condition: Use the property of rational numbers to express the condition `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`.
3. Common Denominator Implication: Deduce that for the sum of the squares of two rational numbers to have a denominator of 1, both squares must have a denominator of 1.
4. Backtrack to Original Denominators: Conclude that if both `x^2` and `y^2` have a denominator of 1, then `x` and `y` themselves must have the same denominator, leveraging the property of rational numbers squared.
5. Finalize with Equality: Use logical reasoning and properties of rational numbers to assert the equality of the denominators of `x` and `y`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Rational Numbers Representation: Recognize that any rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is positive and the fraction is in its simplest form. This implies that the square of a rational number also has an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator.
2. Integer Denominator Property: Use the fact that the denominator of the sum of two rational numbers is an integer (specifically, 1 in this case) to infer properties about the denominators of the individual numbers. This step involves understanding how the sum of two rational squares could yield an integer.
3. Common Denominator Analysis: Analyze the condition that the sum of the squares of two rational numbers has a denominator of 1. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the two numbers must divide the product of the denominators when squared.
4. Denominator Equality: Show that for the sum of the squares to have a denominator of 1, the simplest form must have been achieved by canceling out all factors in the denominator. This implies that the denominators of `x` and `y` must be the same, as any difference would result in a denominator in the sum that is not 1.
5. Conclude with Equality: Conclude that since the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal for their squares' sum to have a denominator of 1, `x.den = y.den`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.78
1. Rational Numbers Property: Recall that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Apply Property to `x` and `y`: Use the property from step 1 to express the denominators of `x^2` and `y^2` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. Integer Denominator Implication: Since `(x^2 + y^2).den = 1` implies that `x^2 + y^2` is an integer, deduce that the sum of their squares has a denominator of 1.
4. Common Denominator Requirement: Infer that for the sum of two rational squares to have a denominator of 1, the individual squares must share a common denominator.
5. Conclude Equality of Denominators: Conclude that `x.den` must equal `y.den` based on the requirement that their squares contribute to a sum with a denominator of 1, leveraging properties of rational numbers and their operations.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.75
1. Analyze the structure of rational numbers: Recognize that a rational number can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. This understanding is crucial for manipulating the expressions involving `x` and `y`.
2. Express `x` and `y` in terms of their numerators and denominators: Use the property that any rational number `q` can be expressed as `q.num / q.den`, where `q.num` is the numerator and `q.den` is the denominator.
3. Expand and simplify the given condition: Expand `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` using the representation of `x` and `y` as fractions. This involves squaring the fractions and adding them, leading to a common denominator expression.
4. Utilize properties of rational numbers: Apply properties of rational numbers and their operations to deduce that for the denominator of the sum of two squared rational numbers to be `1`, certain conditions must be met by the denominators of the individual numbers.
5. Prove equality of denominators: Show that for the denominator of the sum `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` to be `1`, the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal. This may involve showing that any common factors in the denominators must be present in both `x` and `y` to avoid increasing the denominator of the sum beyond `1`.
6. Conclude with the equality of denominators: Deduce that since the denominator of `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` is `1`, and based on the properties of rational numbers and the manipulation of the expression, it follows that `x.den = y.den`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.74
1. Rational Numbers Property: Start by recognizing that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Simplify Given Condition: Use the property of rational numbers to express the condition `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`.
3. Common Denominator Implication: Deduce that for the sum of the squares of two rational numbers to have a denominator of 1, both squares must have a denominator of 1.
4. Backtrack to Original Denominators: Conclude that if both `x^2` and `y^2` have a denominator of 1, then `x` and `y` themselves must have the same denominator, leveraging the property of rational numbers squared.
5. Finalize with Equality: Use logical reasoning and properties of rational numbers to assert the equality of the denominators of `x` and `y`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.67
1. Rational Numbers Representation: Recognize that any rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is positive and the fraction is in its simplest form. This implies that the square of a rational number also has an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator.
2. Integer Denominator Property: Use the fact that the denominator of the sum of two rational numbers is an integer (specifically, 1 in this case) to infer properties about the denominators of the individual numbers. This step involves understanding how the sum of two rational squares could yield an integer.
3. Common Denominator Analysis: Analyze the condition that the sum of the squares of two rational numbers has a denominator of 1. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the two numbers must divide the product of the denominators when squared.
4. Denominator Equality: Show that for the sum of the squares to have a denominator of 1, the simplest form must have been achieved by canceling out all factors in the denominator. This implies that the denominators of `x` and `y` must be the same, as any difference would result in a denominator in the sum that is not 1.
5. Conclude with Equality: Conclude that since the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal for their squares' sum to have a denominator of 1, `x.den = y.den`.

1. Rational Numbers Property: Recall that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Apply Property to `x` and `y`: Use the property from step 1 to express the denominators of `x^2` and `y^2` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. Integer Denominator Implication: Since `(x^2 + y^2).den = 1` implies that `x^2 + y^2` is an integer, deduce that the sum of their squares has a denominator of 1.
4. Common Denominator Requirement: Infer that for the sum of two rational squares to have a denominator of 1, the individual squares must share a common denominator.
5. Conclude Equality of Denominators: Conclude that `x.den` must equal `y.den` based on the requirement that their squares contribute to a sum with a denominator of 1, leveraging properties of rational numbers and their operations.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.96
1. Analyze the structure of rational numbers: Recognize that a rational number can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. This understanding is crucial for manipulating the expressions involving `x` and `y`.
2. Express `x` and `y` in terms of their numerators and denominators: Use the property that any rational number `q` can be expressed as `q.num / q.den`, where `q.num` is the numerator and `q.den` is the denominator.
3. Expand and simplify the given condition: Expand `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` using the representation of `x` and `y` as fractions. This involves squaring the fractions and adding them, leading to a common denominator expression.
4. Utilize properties of rational numbers: Apply properties of rational numbers and their operations to deduce that for the denominator of the sum of two squared rational numbers to be `1`, certain conditions must be met by the denominators of the individual numbers.
5. Prove equality of denominators: Show that for the denominator of the sum `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` to be `1`, the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal. This may involve showing that any common factors in the denominators must be present in both `x` and `y` to avoid increasing the denominator of the sum beyond `1`.
6. Conclude with the equality of denominators: Deduce that since the denominator of `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` is `1`, and based on the properties of rational numbers and the manipulation of the expression, it follows that `x.den = y.den`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.74
1. Rational Numbers Property: Start by recognizing that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Simplify Given Condition: Use the property of rational numbers to express the condition `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`.
3. Common Denominator Implication: Deduce that for the sum of the squares of two rational numbers to have a denominator of 1, both squares must have a denominator of 1.
4. Backtrack to Original Denominators: Conclude that if both `x^2` and `y^2` have a denominator of 1, then `x` and `y` themselves must have the same denominator, leveraging the property of rational numbers squared.
5. Finalize with Equality: Use logical reasoning and properties of rational numbers to assert the equality of the denominators of `x` and `y`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.67
1. Rational Numbers Representation: Recognize that any rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is positive and the fraction is in its simplest form. This implies that the square of a rational number also has an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator.
2. Integer Denominator Property: Use the fact that the denominator of the sum of two rational numbers is an integer (specifically, 1 in this case) to infer properties about the denominators of the individual numbers. This step involves understanding how the sum of two rational squares could yield an integer.
3. Common Denominator Analysis: Analyze the condition that the sum of the squares of two rational numbers has a denominator of 1. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the two numbers must divide the product of the denominators when squared.
4. Denominator Equality: Show that for the sum of the squares to have a denominator of 1, the simplest form must have been achieved by canceling out all factors in the denominator. This implies that the denominators of `x` and `y` must be the same, as any difference would result in a denominator in the sum that is not 1.
5. Conclude with Equality: Conclude that since the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal for their squares' sum to have a denominator of 1, `x.den = y.den`.

1. Rational Numbers Property: Recall that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Apply Property to `x` and `y`: Use the property from step 1 to express the denominators of `x^2` and `y^2` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`, respectively.
3. Integer Denominator Implication: Since `(x^2 + y^2).den = 1` implies that `x^2 + y^2` is an integer, deduce that the sum of their squares has a denominator of 1.
4. Common Denominator Requirement: Infer that for the sum of two rational squares to have a denominator of 1, the individual squares must share a common denominator.
5. Conclude Equality of Denominators: Conclude that `x.den` must equal `y.den` based on the requirement that their squares contribute to a sum with a denominator of 1, leveraging properties of rational numbers and their operations.

1. Analyze the structure of rational numbers: Recognize that a rational number can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. This understanding is crucial for manipulating the expressions involving `x` and `y`.
2. Express `x` and `y` in terms of their numerators and denominators: Use the property that any rational number `q` can be expressed as `q.num / q.den`, where `q.num` is the numerator and `q.den` is the denominator.
3. Expand and simplify the given condition: Expand `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` using the representation of `x` and `y` as fractions. This involves squaring the fractions and adding them, leading to a common denominator expression.
4. Utilize properties of rational numbers: Apply properties of rational numbers and their operations to deduce that for the denominator of the sum of two squared rational numbers to be `1`, certain conditions must be met by the denominators of the individual numbers.
5. Prove equality of denominators: Show that for the denominator of the sum `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` to be `1`, the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal. This may involve showing that any common factors in the denominators must be present in both `x` and `y` to avoid increasing the denominator of the sum beyond `1`.
6. Conclude with the equality of denominators: Deduce that since the denominator of `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` is `1`, and based on the properties of rational numbers and the manipulation of the expression, it follows that `x.den = y.den`.

3. Common Denominator Implication: Deduce that for the sum of the squares of two rational numbers to have a denominator of 1, both squares must have a denominator of 1.
4. Backtrack to Original Denominators: Conclude that if both `x^2` and `y^2` have a denominator of 1, then `x` and `y` themselves must have the same denominator, leveraging the property of rational numbers squared.

1. Rational Numbers Representation: Recognize that any rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is positive and the fraction is in its simplest form. This implies that the square of a rational number also has an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator.
2. Integer Denominator Property: Use the fact that the denominator of the sum of two rational numbers is an integer (specifically, 1 in this case) to infer properties about the denominators of the individual numbers. This step involves understanding how the sum of two rational squares could yield an integer.
3. Common Denominator Analysis: Analyze the condition that the sum of the squares of two rational numbers has a denominator of 1. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the two numbers must divide the product of the denominators when squared.
4. Denominator Equality: Show that for the sum of the squares to have a denominator of 1, the simplest form must have been achieved by canceling out all factors in the denominator. This implies that the denominators of `x` and `y` must be the same, as any difference would result in a denominator in the sum that is not 1.
5. Conclude with Equality: Conclude that since the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal for their squares' sum to have a denominator of 1, `x.den = y.den`.

1. Analyze the structure of rational numbers: Recognize that a rational number can be represented as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. This understanding is crucial for manipulating the expressions involving `x` and `y`.
2. Express `x` and `y` in terms of their numerators and denominators: Use the property that any rational number `q` can be expressed as `q.num / q.den`, where `q.num` is the numerator and `q.den` is the denominator.
3. Expand and simplify the given condition: Expand `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` using the representation of `x` and `y` as fractions. This involves squaring the fractions and adding them, leading to a common denominator expression.
4. Utilize properties of rational numbers: Apply properties of rational numbers and their operations to deduce that for the denominator of the sum of two squared rational numbers to be `1`, certain conditions must be met by the denominators of the individual numbers.
5. Prove equality of denominators: Show that for the denominator of the sum `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` to be `1`, the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal. This may involve showing that any common factors in the denominators must be present in both `x` and `y` to avoid increasing the denominator of the sum beyond `1`.
6. Conclude with the equality of denominators: Deduce that since the denominator of `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)` is `1`, and based on the properties of rational numbers and the manipulation of the expression, it follows that `x.den = y.den`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.49
1. Rational Numbers Property: Start by recognizing that for any rational number, its square's denominator is the square of the original denominator.
2. Simplify Given Condition: Use the property of rational numbers to express the condition `(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2).den = 1` in terms of the denominators of `x` and `y`.
3. Common Denominator Implication: Deduce that for the sum of the squares of two rational numbers to have a denominator of 1, both squares must have a denominator of 1.
4. Backtrack to Original Denominators: Conclude that if both `x^2` and `y^2` have a denominator of 1, then `x` and `y` themselves must have the same denominator, leveraging the property of rational numbers squared.
5. Finalize with Equality: Use logical reasoning and properties of rational numbers to assert the equality of the denominators of `x` and `y`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.49
1. Rational Numbers Representation: Recognize that any rational number can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is positive and the fraction is in its simplest form. This implies that the square of a rational number also has an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator.
2. Integer Denominator Property: Use the fact that the denominator of the sum of two rational numbers is an integer (specifically, 1 in this case) to infer properties about the denominators of the individual numbers. This step involves understanding how the sum of two rational squares could yield an integer.
3. Common Denominator Analysis: Analyze the condition that the sum of the squares of two rational numbers has a denominator of 1. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the two numbers must divide the product of the denominators when squared.
4. Denominator Equality: Show that for the sum of the squares to have a denominator of 1, the simplest form must have been achieved by canceling out all factors in the denominator. This implies that the denominators of `x` and `y` must be the same, as any difference would result in a denominator in the sum that is not 1.
5. Conclude with Equality: Conclude that since the denominators of `x` and `y` must be equal for their squares' sum to have a denominator of 1, `x.den = y.den`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.85
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.78
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.77
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.59
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.0
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.94
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.95
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.55
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.97
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.91
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.93
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.85
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.89
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.9
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.83
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.87
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.52
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.81
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.52
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.79
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.51
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\).
2. Apply Given Values: Substitute the given initial values of \(x_1\), \(x_2\), \(x_3\), and \(x_4\) into the expressions obtained from the recurrence relation.
3. Simplify Expressions: Simplify the expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) using the values from step 2. This might involve recognizing a pattern or a simplification that occurs due to the nature of the recurrence relation.
4. Sum the Values: Add the simplified expressions for \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) together.
5. Prove Equality: Use arithmetic or induction to show that the sum obtained in step 4 equals 898.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Establish a recurrence relation: Use the given recursive formula for \(x_n\) when \(n \geq 5\) to express \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\) in terms of earlier values of \(x\).
2. Identify a pattern: Look for a pattern in the sequence generated by the recurrence relation. This might involve recognizing periodicity or stability in the sequence values.
3. Apply initial conditions: Use the initial values \(x_1 = 211\), \(x_2 = 375\), \(x_3 = 420\), and \(x_4 = 523\) to calculate specific values of \(x_n\) that are relevant to the pattern identified in step 2.
4. Simplify the expression: Combine the insights from the pattern recognition and the initial conditions to simplify the expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).
5. Prove the sum equals 898: Use linear arithmetic to show that the simplified expression for \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\) indeed equals 898, completing the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Establish Recurrence Relation: Use the given recursive formula for `x n` when `n ≥ 5` to express `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` in terms of the previous four terms.
2. Simplify Using Base Cases: Recognize that due to the nature of the recurrence relation, the value of `x n` for any `n` can ultimately be expressed in terms of the base cases `x 1`, `x 2`, `x 3`, and `x 4`.
3. Apply Induction: Employ mathematical induction on `n` to prove the recurrence relation holds for all `n ≥ 5`. This step may involve proving a base case for the induction and then showing that if the relation holds for some `n`, it also holds for `n + 1`.
4. Calculate Specific Values: Calculate the specific values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the established recurrence relation and the base cases.
5. Sum the Values: Add `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` together.
6. Simplify to Find the Sum: Use arithmetic simplification to show that the sum equals 898. This may involve recognizing patterns in the recurrence relation that lead to simplifications in the sum.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.47
1. Establish recurrence relation: Start by acknowledging the given recurrence relation for `x n` when `n ≥ 5`.
2. Compute specific values: Calculate the values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975` using the recurrence relation. This step involves iteratively applying the recurrence relation to find the values at these specific points.
3. Use induction for simplification: Apply mathematical induction to simplify the computation process for `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`. This could involve showing that the sequence or some function of the sequence has a periodicity or a pattern that simplifies the calculation.
4. Sum the values: Add the computed values of `x 531`, `x 753`, and `x 975`.
5. Apply linear arithmetic: Use linear arithmetic to show that the sum of these values equals 898, as per the given statement.
6. Conclude the proof: Combine the steps above to conclude that `x 531 + x 753 + x 975 = 898`.
