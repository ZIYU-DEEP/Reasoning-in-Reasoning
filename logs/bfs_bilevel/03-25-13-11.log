======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.78
1. Simplify expressions for `q` and `p`: Recognize that both sequences are arithmetic series with alternating signs. Simplify them by summing their terms, considering the pattern of their addition and subtraction.
2. Calculate explicit values for `q` and `p`: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find explicit expressions for `q` and `p`. This involves identifying the first term, the common difference, and the number of terms for each series.
3. Divide `q` by `p`: After finding explicit expressions for `q` and `p`, divide `q` by `p` to get a simplified fraction.
4. Simplify the fraction to `2 / 3`: Use basic arithmetic simplification to show that the fraction obtained from dividing `q` by `p` simplifies to `2 / 3`.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Simplify the expressions for `q` and `p`: Recognize that both sequences are arithmetic series with alternating signs. Simplify each series to find their sums.
2. Calculate the sum of `q`: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, considering the alternating signs, to calculate the sum of the series defined for `q`.
3. Calculate the sum of `p`: Similarly, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, adjusting for the alternating signs, to calculate the sum of the series defined for `p`.
4. Divide `q` by `p`: After finding the simplified forms of `q` and `p`, divide the sum of `q` by the sum of `p`.
5. Show that the result equals `2 / 3`: Use linear arithmetic to prove that the quotient of the simplified sums equals `2 / 3`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.74
1. Simplify the expressions for `q` and `p`: Recognize that both sequences are arithmetic series with alternating signs. For `q`, the common difference is `2`, and for `p`, it is `3`. Simplify both series to find their sums.
2. Calculate the sums: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sums of both sequences. Note the pattern of alternating signs and apply it appropriately to each series.
3. Divide `q` by `p`: With the sums of `q` and `p` calculated, express the division of `q` by `p` as a fraction.
4. Simplify the fraction: Use properties of fractions and arithmetic to simplify the expression obtained in the previous step to `2 / 3`.
5. Conclude the proof: Use `norm_num` or `linarith` to finalize the proof by showing the simplified fraction is indeed `2 / 3`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Simplify Expressions: Use the `norm_num` tactic to simplify both the numerator (q) and the denominator (p) according to their given definitions.
2. Calculate the Simplified Values: After simplification, calculate the actual values of `q` and `p` to establish their relationship.
3. Apply the Simplified Relationship: Use the calculated values of `q` and `p` to rewrite the goal `q / p = 2 / 3`.
4. Finalize with Arithmetic Simplification: Employ `norm_num` again to verify that the simplified expressions of `q` and `p` indeed yield a quotient of `2 / 3`.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.72
1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and right sides of the inequality to simplify the expression. This can be done using the `ring` tactic to handle polynomial expressions.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on one side to facilitate comparison. This step may involve applying `linarith` or further use of `ring` to simplify the rearranged inequality.
3. Apply AM-GM inequality: Recognize that the inequality resembles an application of the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. Specifically, identify terms on the rearranged inequality that can be interpreted as the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.
4. Justify the application of AM-GM: Ensure that the terms involved in the AM-GM application are non-negative. This may involve proving separately that certain expressions are non-negative, possibly using `linarith` or assumptions about the variables.
5. Conclude the proof: Use the established AM-GM inequality to justify the original inequality. This might involve a final application of `linarith` to show that the inequality holds based on the AM-GM inequality and any additional simplifications made.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.71
1. Expand both sides: Use the `simp` or `ring` tactic to fully expand both sides of the inequality, simplifying the algebraic expressions.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to get all terms on one side of the inequality to facilitate comparison. This might involve subtracting terms from both sides or factoring.
3. Apply the AM-GM inequality or recognize a perfect square: Look for opportunities to apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality or to recognize that the terms can form a perfect square, which is always non-negative. This step may involve creative algebraic manipulation.
4. Conclude with non-negativity: Once the expression is recognized as a perfect square or after applying AM-GM, conclude that the expression is non-negative, which satisfies the inequality. Use `linarith` or direct argumentation to finalize the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.69
1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and the right sides of the inequality to eliminate parentheses and simplify the expression wherever possible.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on each side or move all terms to one side to form a standard form of an inequality, which could potentially reveal a recognizable pattern or simplify further analysis.
3. Apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality: Look for opportunities to apply the AM-GM inequality to parts of the rearranged inequality. This could involve comparing the squares and products of `a` and `c` or their linear combinations.
4. Simplify using AM-GM outcomes: Use the results from applying the AM-GM inequality to simplify the inequality further, potentially reducing it to a form that is obviously true or directly provable through simple arithmetic or algebraic manipulation.
5. Conclude with any necessary algebraic manipulations: After applying AM-GM and simplifying, there may be a need for final touches through basic algebraic manipulations to fully prove the inequality.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.67
1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and right sides of the inequality to eliminate parentheses and simplify the expression. This can involve using the `ring` tactic to handle polynomial expressions efficiently.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on one side to facilitate comparison. This might involve moving all terms to one side of the inequality to set it up for further simplification.
3. Apply the AM-GM inequality: Recognize that the inequality can be approached by applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality on suitable terms. This step might not be directly reflected in Lean but is part of the conceptual approach.
4. Simplify and conclude: Use `linarith` or `nlinarith` to handle the final simplified inequality. This step involves leveraging the linear or mildly nonlinear arithmetic capabilities of Lean to conclude the proof based on the rearranged and simplified inequality.

1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and right sides of the inequality to simplify the expression. This can be done using the `ring` tactic to handle polynomial expressions.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on one side to facilitate comparison. This step may involve applying `linarith` or further use of `ring` to simplify the rearranged inequality.
3. Apply AM-GM inequality: Recognize that the inequality resembles an application of the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. Specifically, identify terms on the rearranged inequality that can be interpreted as the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.
4. Justify the application of AM-GM: Ensure that the terms involved in the AM-GM application are non-negative. This may involve proving separately that certain expressions are non-negative, possibly using `linarith` or assumptions about the variables.
5. Conclude the proof: Use the established AM-GM inequality to justify the original inequality. This might involve a final application of `linarith` to show that the inequality holds based on the AM-GM inequality and any additional simplifications made.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.89
1. Expand both sides: Use the `simp` or `ring` tactic to fully expand both sides of the inequality, simplifying the algebraic expressions.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to get all terms on one side of the inequality to facilitate comparison. This might involve subtracting terms from both sides or factoring.
3. Apply the AM-GM inequality or recognize a perfect square: Look for opportunities to apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality or to recognize that the terms can form a perfect square, which is always non-negative. This step may involve creative algebraic manipulation.
4. Conclude with non-negativity: Once the expression is recognized as a perfect square or after applying AM-GM, conclude that the expression is non-negative, which satisfies the inequality. Use `linarith` or direct argumentation to finalize the proof.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.59
1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and the right sides of the inequality to eliminate parentheses and simplify the expression wherever possible.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on each side or move all terms to one side to form a standard form of an inequality, which could potentially reveal a recognizable pattern or simplify further analysis.
3. Apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality: Look for opportunities to apply the AM-GM inequality to parts of the rearranged inequality. This could involve comparing the squares and products of `a` and `c` or their linear combinations.
4. Simplify using AM-GM outcomes: Use the results from applying the AM-GM inequality to simplify the inequality further, potentially reducing it to a form that is obviously true or directly provable through simple arithmetic or algebraic manipulation.
5. Conclude with any necessary algebraic manipulations: After applying AM-GM and simplifying, there may be a need for final touches through basic algebraic manipulations to fully prove the inequality.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.55
1. Expand both sides: Begin by expanding the left and right sides of the inequality to eliminate parentheses and simplify the expression. This can involve using the `ring` tactic to handle polynomial expressions efficiently.
2. Rearrange the inequality: Aim to collect like terms on one side to facilitate comparison. This might involve moving all terms to one side of the inequality to set it up for further simplification.
3. Apply the AM-GM inequality: Recognize that the inequality can be approached by applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality on suitable terms. This step might not be directly reflected in Lean but is part of the conceptual approach.
4. Simplify and conclude: Use `linarith` or `nlinarith` to handle the final simplified inequality. This step involves leveraging the linear or mildly nonlinear arithmetic capabilities of Lean to conclude the proof based on the rearranged and simplified inequality.

1. Understand the prime factorization: Recognize that determining the divisibility by $15^n$ is equivalent to understanding the divisibility by its prime factors, $3$ and $5$, since $15 = 3 \times 5$. The problem thus reduces to finding the maximum powers of $3$ and $5$ that divide $942!$.
2. Factorial prime power divisibility: Use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$, which is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \rfloor$. This formula accounts for all multiples of $p$, multiples of $p^2$, and so on, present in the factorial.
3. Calculate for prime $5$: Apply the formula to calculate the highest power of $5$ that divides $942!$. This involves summing the floor of divisions of $942$ by $5$, $25$, $125$, and so on, until the division results in zero.
4. Calculate for prime $3$: Similarly, apply the formula to calculate the highest power of $3$ that divides $942!$. This involves a similar process as for $5$, but with $3$, $9$, $27$, and so on.
5. Determine the limiting factor: Recognize that since $15^n = 3^n \times 5^n$, the limiting factor will be the smaller of the two powers calculated for $3$ and $5$. This is because both primes must be raised to the same power $n$ to maintain the form $15^n$.
6. Conclude with the minimum: Conclude that the largest possible $n$ is determined by the smaller of the two powers calculated, which corresponds to the maximum power of $15$ that divides $942!$.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.77
1. Factorize the divisor: Recognize that \(15^n = 3^n \times 5^n\). This factorization is crucial because it allows us to treat the problem in terms of prime factors, which are easier to count in the factorial.
2. Count the factors of 3 and 5 in \(942!\): Use Legendre's formula to count the number of times 3 and 5 appear as factors in \(942!\). This involves summing the integer parts of \(942/3^k\) and \(942/5^k\) for \(k=1,2,3,\ldots\) until these quantities are zero.
3. Determine the limiting factor: Since \(15^n\) requires both 3 and 5 to the power of \(n\), the limiting factor will be the one that appears fewer times. Between 3 and 5, 5 is less frequent in prime factorizations of factorials because 3 appears more often due to its smaller value.
4. Calculate the maximum \(n\): Once the number of 5's in \(942!\) is known, this number directly gives the largest possible \(n\) for which \(15^n\) divides \(942!\), as each \(15^n\) requires one 5 and one 3, and there are fewer 5's.
5. Conclude that the largest \(n\) is 233: After performing the calculations, conclude that 233 is the greatest \(n\) such that \(15^n\) divides \(942!\), based on the counts of 5's in the factorial.

3. Count multiples of 3 and 5: For each prime factor (3 and 5), calculate the number of times it divides 942!, taking into account all powers of the prime factor. This involves summing the floor of 942 divided by each power of the prime until the quotient is zero.

4. Determine the limiting prime factor: Compare the counts of 3s and 5s to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller count. This is because the power of 15 is determined by the lesser of the two counts (since 15 requires both a 3 and a 5).

5. Conclude the highest power: The highest power of 15 that divides 942! is the minimum of the counts of 3s and 5s. This involves straightforward arithmetic to sum the contributions from each prime factor.

6. Verify the result: Finally, ensure the calculation is correct and corresponds to the given number, 233, as the largest integer n for which 15^n divides 942!.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.73

3. Calculate Powers: Compute the powers of 3 and 5 that divide 942! using Legendre's formula, focusing on the sum of quotients of 942 divided by each power of 3 and 5, respectively.

1. Understand the prime factorization: Recognize that determining the divisibility by $15^n$ is equivalent to understanding the divisibility by its prime factors, $3$ and $5$, since $15 = 3 \times 5$. The problem thus reduces to finding the maximum powers of $3$ and $5$ that divide $942!$.
2. Factorial prime power divisibility: Use the formula for the highest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$, which is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \rfloor$. This formula accounts for all multiples of $p$, multiples of $p^2$, and so on, present in the factorial.
3. Calculate for prime $5$: Apply the formula to calculate the highest power of $5$ that divides $942!$. This involves summing the floor of divisions of $942$ by $5$, $25$, $125$, and so on, until the division results in zero.
4. Calculate for prime $3$: Similarly, apply the formula to calculate the highest power of $3$ that divides $942!$. This involves a similar process as for $5$, but with $3$, $9$, $27$, and so on.
5. Determine the limiting factor: Recognize that since $15^n = 3^n \times 5^n$, the limiting factor will be the smaller of the two powers calculated for $3$ and $5$. This is because both primes must be raised to the same power $n$ to maintain the form $15^n$.
6. Conclude with the minimum: Conclude that the largest possible $n$ is determined by the smaller of the two powers calculated, which corresponds to the maximum power of $15$ that divides $942!$.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Factorize the divisor: Recognize that \(15^n = 3^n \times 5^n\). This factorization is crucial because it allows us to treat the problem in terms of prime factors, which are easier to count in the factorial.
2. Count the factors of 3 and 5 in \(942!\): Use Legendre's formula to count the number of times 3 and 5 appear as factors in \(942!\). This involves summing the integer parts of \(942/3^k\) and \(942/5^k\) for \(k=1,2,3,\ldots\) until these quantities are zero.
3. Determine the limiting factor: Since \(15^n\) requires both 3 and 5 to the power of \(n\), the limiting factor will be the one that appears fewer times. Between 3 and 5, 5 is less frequent in prime factorizations of factorials because 3 appears more often due to its smaller value.
4. Calculate the maximum \(n\): Once the number of 5's in \(942!\) is known, this number directly gives the largest possible \(n\) for which \(15^n\) divides \(942!\), as each \(15^n\) requires one 5 and one 3, and there are fewer 5's.
5. Conclude that the largest \(n\) is 233: After performing the calculations, conclude that 233 is the greatest \(n\) such that \(15^n\) divides \(942!\), based on the counts of 5's in the factorial.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Understand the problem: The task is to find the highest power of 15 that divides 942!. Since 15 is the product of 3 and 5, the problem reduces to finding the minimum of the highest powers of 3 and 5 that divide 942!.

2. Factorize 15: Recognize that 15 = 3 * 5, so we need to count the multiples of 3 and 5 (including multiples of 3^2, 3^3, etc., and 5^2, 5^3, etc.) in the prime factorization of 942!.

3. Count multiples of 3 and 5: For each prime factor (3 and 5), calculate the number of times it divides 942!, taking into account all powers of the prime factor. This involves summing the floor of 942 divided by each power of the prime until the quotient is zero.

4. Determine the limiting prime factor: Compare the counts of 3s and 5s to find the limiting factor, which is the smaller count. This is because the power of 15 is determined by the lesser of the two counts (since 15 requires both a 3 and a 5).

5. Conclude the highest power: The highest power of 15 that divides 942! is the minimum of the counts of 3s and 5s. This involves straightforward arithmetic to sum the contributions from each prime factor.

6. Verify the result: Finally, ensure the calculation is correct and corresponds to the given number, 233, as the largest integer n for which 15^n divides 942!.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.84
1. Factor 15: Recognize that 15 can be factored into 3 and 5, which implies we need to find the maximum power of both 3 and 5 that divides 942!.
2. Legendre's Formula: Apply Legendre's formula for both prime factors 3 and 5 to find the number of times each divides 942!.
3. Calculate Powers: Compute the powers of 3 and 5 that divide 942! using Legendre's formula, focusing on the sum of quotients of 942 divided by each power of 3 and 5, respectively.
4. Determine the Minimum: Since 15^n requires both 3^n and 5^n to divide 942!, the maximum n is determined by the lesser of the two powers calculated in step 3.
5. Conclude with the Lesser Power: Conclude that the maximum power of 15 that divides 942! is determined by the smaller of the two powers of 3 and 5 found, which should be shown to be 233.

1. Understand the inequality: Recognize that the inequality `abs (x + 4) < 9` defines a range of integers for which the function `f` takes on values less than 9.
2. Solve the inequality: Solve the inequality `abs (x + 4) < 9` to find the range of `x` that satisfies it. This involves considering both cases of the absolute value (positive and negative scenarios) and simplifying to find that `x` lies between `-13` and `5`.
3. Count the integers in the range: Determine the number of integer values within the range `-13` to `5`, inclusive. This can be done by noting that the range includes both endpoints and counting the total number of integers in this interval.
4. Apply the given conditions: Use the given conditions `∀ x, f x = abs (x + 4)` and `∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ f x < 9` to relate the solution of the inequality directly to the elements of the set `s`.

3. Simplify both cases: Simplify the inequalities to find the range of `x` that satisfies each case, which will be `-13 < x < 5`.
4. Count the integers in the range: Calculate the number of integer values within the range `-13 < x < 5`, which includes all integers from `-12` to `4`.
5. Conclude the cardinality: Conclude that the cardinality of the set `s`, which consists of all integers satisfying the given inequality, is `17`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Interpret the inequality: Understand that the inequality `abs (x + 4) < 9` defines a range of integers for which the function `f` takes values less than 9.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.84
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to show that \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 \geq 0\).
2. Recognize a quadratic form: Observe that the rearranged inequality represents a quadratic equation in standard form. 
3. Apply the discriminant method: Use the discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) of the quadratic equation to determine the nature of its roots. Here, \(a = 28\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 1\).
4. Calculate the discriminant: Compute the value of the discriminant \(\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 28 \cdot 1\).
5. Analyze discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative, which implies the quadratic equation has no real roots.
6. Conclude the inequality: Use the fact that a quadratic equation with no real roots and a positive leading coefficient (\(a = 28 > 0\)) is always positive. Therefore, \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 > 0\), or equivalently, \(10a \leq 28a^2 + 1\).

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.83
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where one side is zero. This involves moving all terms to one side of the inequality, resulting in `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality involves a quadratic expression. Use the quadratic formula to analyze the roots of the corresponding equation `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 = 0`.
3. Determine the discriminant: Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by `b^2 - 4ac`, where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`. This step is crucial to understand the nature of the roots.
4. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, and therefore, the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` is always positive for all real numbers `a`.
5. Conclude the inequality: Since the quadratic expression is always positive, it follows that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` holds true for all real numbers `a`, which directly leads to the conclusion that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.82
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where all terms are on one side. This involves moving all terms to one side to get a quadratic inequality of the form `0 ≤ 28a^2 - 10a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality can be analyzed through the discriminant of the quadratic equation `28a^2 - 10a + 1 = 0`. Calculate the discriminant `Δ = b^2 - 4ac` where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`.
3. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This step involves proving that `Δ < 0` using direct calculation or `norm_num`.
4. Conclude based on the discriminant: Use the fact that a negative discriminant implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, which in turn implies that `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always positive (or zero) for all real numbers `a`.
5. Finalize the proof: Since `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always non-negative, conclude that the original inequality `10 * a ≤ 28 * a ^ 2 + 1` holds for all real numbers `a`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.79
1. Rearrange the inequality: Begin by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to prove `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply Completing the Square: Use the method of completing the square on the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` to transform it into a form that clearly shows it is always non-negative. This involves expressing it as `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2 + constant`, where `constant` is a positive number.
3. Show Non-negativity: Highlight that the squared term `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2` is always non-negative, as any real number squared is non-negative.
4. Conclude with the Positive Constant: Argue that since the squared term is non-negative and it is being added to a positive constant, the entire expression is always non-negative. This demonstrates that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`, completing the proof.

4. Conclude with the Positive Constant: Argue that since the squared term is non-negative and it is being added to a positive constant, the entire expression is always non-negative. This demonstrates that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`, completing the proof.

Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.01
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to show that \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 \geq 0\).
2. Recognize a quadratic form: Observe that the rearranged inequality represents a quadratic equation in standard form. 
3. Apply the discriminant method: Use the discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) of the quadratic equation to determine the nature of its roots. Here, \(a = 28\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 1\).
4. Calculate the discriminant: Compute the value of the discriminant \(\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 28 \cdot 1\).
5. Analyze discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative, which implies the quadratic equation has no real roots.
6. Conclude the inequality: Use the fact that a quadratic equation with no real roots and a positive leading coefficient (\(a = 28 > 0\)) is always positive. Therefore, \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 > 0\), or equivalently, \(10a \leq 28a^2 + 1\).

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.98
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where one side is zero. This involves moving all terms to one side of the inequality, resulting in `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality involves a quadratic expression. Use the quadratic formula to analyze the roots of the corresponding equation `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 = 0`.
3. Determine the discriminant: Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by `b^2 - 4ac`, where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`. This step is crucial to understand the nature of the roots.
4. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, and therefore, the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` is always positive for all real numbers `a`.
5. Conclude the inequality: Since the quadratic expression is always positive, it follows that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` holds true for all real numbers `a`, which directly leads to the conclusion that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.99
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where all terms are on one side. This involves moving all terms to one side to get a quadratic inequality of the form `0 ≤ 28a^2 - 10a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality can be analyzed through the discriminant of the quadratic equation `28a^2 - 10a + 1 = 0`. Calculate the discriminant `Δ = b^2 - 4ac` where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`.
3. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This step involves proving that `Δ < 0` using direct calculation or `norm_num`.
4. Conclude based on the discriminant: Use the fact that a negative discriminant implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, which in turn implies that `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always positive (or zero) for all real numbers `a`.
5. Finalize the proof: Since `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always non-negative, conclude that the original inequality `10 * a ≤ 28 * a ^ 2 + 1` holds for all real numbers `a`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.97
1. Rearrange the inequality: Begin by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to prove `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply Completing the Square: Use the method of completing the square on the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` to transform it into a form that clearly shows it is always non-negative. This involves expressing it as `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2 + constant`, where `constant` is a positive number.
3. Show Non-negativity: Highlight that the squared term `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2` is always non-negative, as any real number squared is non-negative.
4. Conclude with the Positive Constant: Argue that since the squared term is non-negative and it is being added to a positive constant, the entire expression is always non-negative. This demonstrates that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.55
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to show that \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 \geq 0\).
2. Recognize a quadratic form: Observe that the rearranged inequality represents a quadratic equation in standard form. 
3. Apply the discriminant method: Use the discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) of the quadratic equation to determine the nature of its roots. Here, \(a = 28\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 1\).
4. Calculate the discriminant: Compute the value of the discriminant \(\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 28 \cdot 1\).
5. Analyze discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative, which implies the quadratic equation has no real roots.
6. Conclude the inequality: Use the fact that a quadratic equation with no real roots and a positive leading coefficient (\(a = 28 > 0\)) is always positive. Therefore, \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 > 0\), or equivalently, \(10a \leq 28a^2 + 1\).

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.93
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where one side is zero. This involves moving all terms to one side of the inequality, resulting in `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality involves a quadratic expression. Use the quadratic formula to analyze the roots of the corresponding equation `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 = 0`.
3. Determine the discriminant: Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by `b^2 - 4ac`, where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`. This step is crucial to understand the nature of the roots.
4. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, and therefore, the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` is always positive for all real numbers `a`.
5. Conclude the inequality: Since the quadratic expression is always positive, it follows that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` holds true for all real numbers `a`, which directly leads to the conclusion that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.56
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where all terms are on one side. This involves moving all terms to one side to get a quadratic inequality of the form `0 ≤ 28a^2 - 10a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality can be analyzed through the discriminant of the quadratic equation `28a^2 - 10a + 1 = 0`. Calculate the discriminant `Δ = b^2 - 4ac` where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`.
3. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This step involves proving that `Δ < 0` using direct calculation or `norm_num`.
4. Conclude based on the discriminant: Use the fact that a negative discriminant implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, which in turn implies that `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always positive (or zero) for all real numbers `a`.
5. Finalize the proof: Since `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always non-negative, conclude that the original inequality `10 * a ≤ 28 * a ^ 2 + 1` holds for all real numbers `a`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.92
1. Rearrange the inequality: Begin by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to prove `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply Completing the Square: Use the method of completing the square on the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` to transform it into a form that clearly shows it is always non-negative. This involves expressing it as `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2 + constant`, where `constant` is a positive number.
3. Show Non-negativity: Highlight that the squared term `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2` is always non-negative, as any real number squared is non-negative.
4. Conclude with the Positive Constant: Argue that since the squared term is non-negative and it is being added to a positive constant, the entire expression is always non-negative. This demonstrates that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.53
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to show that \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 \geq 0\).
2. Recognize a quadratic form: Observe that the rearranged inequality represents a quadratic equation in standard form. 
3. Apply the discriminant method: Use the discriminant \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\) of the quadratic equation to determine the nature of its roots. Here, \(a = 28\), \(b = -10\), and \(c = 1\).
4. Calculate the discriminant: Compute the value of the discriminant \(\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4 \cdot 28 \cdot 1\).
5. Analyze discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative, which implies the quadratic equation has no real roots.
6. Conclude the inequality: Use the fact that a quadratic equation with no real roots and a positive leading coefficient (\(a = 28 > 0\)) is always positive. Therefore, \(28a^2 - 10a + 1 > 0\), or equivalently, \(10a \leq 28a^2 + 1\).

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.53
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where one side is zero. This involves moving all terms to one side of the inequality, resulting in `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality involves a quadratic expression. Use the quadratic formula to analyze the roots of the corresponding equation `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 = 0`.
3. Determine the discriminant: Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is given by `b^2 - 4ac`, where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`. This step is crucial to understand the nature of the roots.
4. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, and therefore, the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` is always positive for all real numbers `a`.
5. Conclude the inequality: Since the quadratic expression is always positive, it follows that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` holds true for all real numbers `a`, which directly leads to the conclusion that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1`.

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.53
1. Rearrange the inequality: Start by rearranging the given inequality to a standard form where all terms are on one side. This involves moving all terms to one side to get a quadratic inequality of the form `0 ≤ 28a^2 - 10a + 1`.
2. Apply the quadratic formula: Recognize that the inequality can be analyzed through the discriminant of the quadratic equation `28a^2 - 10a + 1 = 0`. Calculate the discriminant `Δ = b^2 - 4ac` where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`.
3. Analyze the discriminant: Show that the discriminant is negative. This step involves proving that `Δ < 0` using direct calculation or `norm_num`.
4. Conclude based on the discriminant: Use the fact that a negative discriminant implies that the quadratic equation has no real roots, which in turn implies that `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always positive (or zero) for all real numbers `a`.
5. Finalize the proof: Since `28a^2 - 10a + 1` is always non-negative, conclude that the original inequality `10 * a ≤ 28 * a ^ 2 + 1` holds for all real numbers `a`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.54
1. Rearrange the inequality: Begin by rearranging the given inequality to bring all terms to one side, aiming to prove `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`.
2. Apply Completing the Square: Use the method of completing the square on the quadratic expression `28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1` to transform it into a form that clearly shows it is always non-negative. This involves expressing it as `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2 + constant`, where `constant` is a positive number.
3. Show Non-negativity: Highlight that the squared term `(sqrt(7)*a - sqrt(7)/2)^2` is always non-negative, as any real number squared is non-negative.
4. Conclude with the Positive Constant: Argue that since the squared term is non-negative and it is being added to a positive constant, the entire expression is always non-negative. This demonstrates that `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`, completing the proof.

1. Simplify the given equation: Start by simplifying the equation `10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)` to get it in a form that makes the relationship between `a` and `b` more explicit.
2. Rearrange and isolate variables: Rearrange the simplified equation to isolate one of the variables (either `a` or `b`) in terms of the other. This step involves algebraic manipulation to express the equation in a more straightforward form.
3. Apply bounds on variables: Utilize the given bounds on `a` and `b` (`1 ≤ a ≤ 9` and `b ≤ 9`) to narrow down the possible values of the variables. This step may involve checking the validity of the derived relationship against the bounds.
4. Solve for the variables: Once the relationship between `a` and `b` is established and simplified, solve for the specific values of `a` and `b` that satisfy both the equation and the given bounds.
5. Verify and conclude: Verify that the found values of `a` and `b` indeed satisfy the original equation and the conditions. Conclude that the two-digit integer formed by `a` and `b` is 18, based on the solution to the equation and the bounds on `a` and `b`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.5
1. Simplify the given equation: Start by simplifying the equation `10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)` to isolate variables and reduce it to a simpler form that can be more directly analyzed.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.8
1. Prime Factorization: Begin by considering the prime factorization of \(n\), \(2n\), and \(3n\). The number of divisors a number has is related to the exponents in its prime factorization.
2. Use Given Information: Apply the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to infer possible exponents in the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\).
3. Determine Exponents for \(6n\): Since \(6n = 2 \times 3 \times n\), combine the inferred exponents from \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce the prime factorization of \(6n\).
4. Calculate Divisors of \(6n\): Use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization of \(6n\) to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude the Proof: Show that the number of divisors of \(6n\) matches the given number (35) by comparing it with the calculated number from the previous step.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.79
1. Understand the Divisor Function: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \(N\) has the prime factorization \(N = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}\), then the number of divisors of \(N\) is given by \((k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)\).

2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\). Since \(2n\) and \(3n\) share the factor \(n\), their prime factorizations will be closely related. The prime factorization of \(6n\) will combine those of \(2n\) and \(3n\) with an additional factor of \(2\) and \(3\), respectively.

3. Deduce the Prime Factorization of \(n\): Use the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce constraints on the prime factorization of \(n\). This step may involve reasoning about how the prime factorization of \(n\) must adjust to accommodate the counts of 28 and 30 divisors for \(2n\) and \(3n\), respectively.

4. Calculate the Number of Divisors of \(6n\): Once the prime factorization of \(n\) is understood, calculate the prime factorization of \(6n\) by appropriately combining and adjusting the factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\), and then applying the divisor function formula to find the number of divisors of \(6n\).

5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of \(6n\) to conclude that it must be 35, as per the given condition. This conclusion will likely involve verifying that the adjustments made to the prime factorization of \(n\) to account for the divisor counts of \(2n\) and \(3n\) indeed lead to a divisor count of 35 for \(6n\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.78
1. Use the properties of divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes can be found by multiplying the number of divisors of each prime factor raised to their respective powers plus one.
2. Factorize `2n` and `3n`: Since `2n` and `3n` are given to have a specific number of divisors, use their prime factorization to deduce the possible prime factors and their powers in `n`.
3. Deduce the prime factorization of `6n`: Combine the prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`, considering that `6n` includes both the prime factors of `2n` and `3n` with possibly increased powers.
4. Calculate the number of divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor counting formula (product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor) to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude that `6n` has 35 divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to show that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 0.76
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes raised to powers is the product of one plus each of those powers. This is due to the divisor function's multiplicative property.
2. Factorize $2n$ and $3n$: Given the number of divisors, deduce possible prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$. This involves understanding that the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ relates to their number of divisors.
3. Determine Common and Unique Prime Factors: Analyze the prime factorizations to identify common factors between $2n$ and $3n$, and factors unique to each. This is crucial for understanding how $6n$'s factorization will differ.
4. Construct $6n$'s Prime Factorization: Use the information about common and unique factors to deduce $6n$'s prime factorization. This step involves combining the unique factors of $2n$ and $3n$ with the doubled prime factor from multiplying by $6$.
5. Calculate $6n$'s Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function property to $6n$'s prime factorization to calculate the number of divisors. This is a direct application of the multiplicative property of the divisor function.
6. Conclude that $6n$ has 35 Divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to confirm that $6n$ indeed has 35 divisors, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.83
1. Prime Factorization: Begin by considering the prime factorization of \(n\), \(2n\), and \(3n\). The number of divisors a number has is related to the exponents in its prime factorization.
2. Use Given Information: Apply the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to infer possible exponents in the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\).
3. Determine Exponents for \(6n\): Since \(6n = 2 \times 3 \times n\), combine the inferred exponents from \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce the prime factorization of \(6n\).
4. Calculate Divisors of \(6n\): Use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization of \(6n\) to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude the Proof: Show that the number of divisors of \(6n\) matches the given number (35) by comparing it with the calculated number from the previous step.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.81
1. Understand the Divisor Function: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \(N\) has the prime factorization \(N = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}\), then the number of divisors of \(N\) is given by \((k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)\).

2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\). Since \(2n\) and \(3n\) share the factor \(n\), their prime factorizations will be closely related. The prime factorization of \(6n\) will combine those of \(2n\) and \(3n\) with an additional factor of \(2\) and \(3\), respectively.

3. Deduce the Prime Factorization of \(n\): Use the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce constraints on the prime factorization of \(n\). This step may involve reasoning about how the prime factorization of \(n\) must adjust to accommodate the counts of 28 and 30 divisors for \(2n\) and \(3n\), respectively.

4. Calculate the Number of Divisors of \(6n\): Once the prime factorization of \(n\) is understood, calculate the prime factorization of \(6n\) by appropriately combining and adjusting the factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\), and then applying the divisor function formula to find the number of divisors of \(6n\).

5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of \(6n\) to conclude that it must be 35, as per the given condition. This conclusion will likely involve verifying that the adjustments made to the prime factorization of \(n\) to account for the divisor counts of \(2n\) and \(3n\) indeed lead to a divisor count of 35 for \(6n\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.79
1. Use the properties of divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes can be found by multiplying the number of divisors of each prime factor raised to their respective powers plus one.
2. Factorize `2n` and `3n`: Since `2n` and `3n` are given to have a specific number of divisors, use their prime factorization to deduce the possible prime factors and their powers in `n`.
3. Deduce the prime factorization of `6n`: Combine the prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`, considering that `6n` includes both the prime factors of `2n` and `3n` with possibly increased powers.
4. Calculate the number of divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor counting formula (product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor) to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude that `6n` has 35 divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to show that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.75
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes raised to powers is the product of one plus each of those powers. This is due to the divisor function's multiplicative property.
2. Factorize $2n$ and $3n$: Given the number of divisors, deduce possible prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$. This involves understanding that the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ relates to their number of divisors.
3. Determine Common and Unique Prime Factors: Analyze the prime factorizations to identify common factors between $2n$ and $3n$, and factors unique to each. This is crucial for understanding how $6n$'s factorization will differ.
4. Construct $6n$'s Prime Factorization: Use the information about common and unique factors to deduce $6n$'s prime factorization. This step involves combining the unique factors of $2n$ and $3n$ with the doubled prime factor from multiplying by $6$.
5. Calculate $6n$'s Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function property to $6n$'s prime factorization to calculate the number of divisors. This is a direct application of the multiplicative property of the divisor function.
6. Conclude that $6n$ has 35 Divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to confirm that $6n$ indeed has 35 divisors, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.04
1. Prime Factorization: Begin by considering the prime factorization of \(n\), \(2n\), and \(3n\). The number of divisors a number has is related to the exponents in its prime factorization.
2. Use Given Information: Apply the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to infer possible exponents in the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\).
3. Determine Exponents for \(6n\): Since \(6n = 2 \times 3 \times n\), combine the inferred exponents from \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce the prime factorization of \(6n\).
4. Calculate Divisors of \(6n\): Use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization of \(6n\) to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude the Proof: Show that the number of divisors of \(6n\) matches the given number (35) by comparing it with the calculated number from the previous step.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 1.85
1. Understand the Divisor Function: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \(N\) has the prime factorization \(N = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}\), then the number of divisors of \(N\) is given by \((k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)\).

2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\). Since \(2n\) and \(3n\) share the factor \(n\), their prime factorizations will be closely related. The prime factorization of \(6n\) will combine those of \(2n\) and \(3n\) with an additional factor of \(2\) and \(3\), respectively.

3. Deduce the Prime Factorization of \(n\): Use the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce constraints on the prime factorization of \(n\). This step may involve reasoning about how the prime factorization of \(n\) must adjust to accommodate the counts of 28 and 30 divisors for \(2n\) and \(3n\), respectively.

4. Calculate the Number of Divisors of \(6n\): Once the prime factorization of \(n\) is understood, calculate the prime factorization of \(6n\) by appropriately combining and adjusting the factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\), and then applying the divisor function formula to find the number of divisors of \(6n\).

5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of \(6n\) to conclude that it must be 35, as per the given condition. This conclusion will likely involve verifying that the adjustments made to the prime factorization of \(n\) to account for the divisor counts of \(2n\) and \(3n\) indeed lead to a divisor count of 35 for \(6n\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.83
1. Use the properties of divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes can be found by multiplying the number of divisors of each prime factor raised to their respective powers plus one.
2. Factorize `2n` and `3n`: Since `2n` and `3n` are given to have a specific number of divisors, use their prime factorization to deduce the possible prime factors and their powers in `n`.
3. Deduce the prime factorization of `6n`: Combine the prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`, considering that `6n` includes both the prime factors of `2n` and `3n` with possibly increased powers.
4. Calculate the number of divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor counting formula (product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor) to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude that `6n` has 35 divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to show that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.79
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes raised to powers is the product of one plus each of those powers. This is due to the divisor function's multiplicative property.
2. Factorize $2n$ and $3n$: Given the number of divisors, deduce possible prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$. This involves understanding that the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ relates to their number of divisors.
3. Determine Common and Unique Prime Factors: Analyze the prime factorizations to identify common factors between $2n$ and $3n$, and factors unique to each. This is crucial for understanding how $6n$'s factorization will differ.
4. Construct $6n$'s Prime Factorization: Use the information about common and unique factors to deduce $6n$'s prime factorization. This step involves combining the unique factors of $2n$ and $3n$ with the doubled prime factor from multiplying by $6$.
5. Calculate $6n$'s Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function property to $6n$'s prime factorization to calculate the number of divisors. This is a direct application of the multiplicative property of the divisor function.
6. Conclude that $6n$ has 35 Divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to confirm that $6n$ indeed has 35 divisors, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 1.02
1. Prime Factorization: Begin by considering the prime factorization of \(n\), \(2n\), and \(3n\). The number of divisors a number has is related to the exponents in its prime factorization.
2. Use Given Information: Apply the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to infer possible exponents in the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\).
3. Determine Exponents for \(6n\): Since \(6n = 2 \times 3 \times n\), combine the inferred exponents from \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce the prime factorization of \(6n\).
4. Calculate Divisors of \(6n\): Use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization of \(6n\) to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude the Proof: Show that the number of divisors of \(6n\) matches the given number (35) by comparing it with the calculated number from the previous step.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.99
1. Understand the Divisor Function: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \(N\) has the prime factorization \(N = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}\), then the number of divisors of \(N\) is given by \((k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)\).

2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\). Since \(2n\) and \(3n\) share the factor \(n\), their prime factorizations will be closely related. The prime factorization of \(6n\) will combine those of \(2n\) and \(3n\) with an additional factor of \(2\) and \(3\), respectively.

3. Deduce the Prime Factorization of \(n\): Use the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce constraints on the prime factorization of \(n\). This step may involve reasoning about how the prime factorization of \(n\) must adjust to accommodate the counts of 28 and 30 divisors for \(2n\) and \(3n\), respectively.

4. Calculate the Number of Divisors of \(6n\): Once the prime factorization of \(n\) is understood, calculate the prime factorization of \(6n\) by appropriately combining and adjusting the factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\), and then applying the divisor function formula to find the number of divisors of \(6n\).

5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of \(6n\) to conclude that it must be 35, as per the given condition. This conclusion will likely involve verifying that the adjustments made to the prime factorization of \(n\) to account for the divisor counts of \(2n\) and \(3n\) indeed lead to a divisor count of 35 for \(6n\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 1.79
1. Use the properties of divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes can be found by multiplying the number of divisors of each prime factor raised to their respective powers plus one.
2. Factorize `2n` and `3n`: Since `2n` and `3n` are given to have a specific number of divisors, use their prime factorization to deduce the possible prime factors and their powers in `n`.
3. Deduce the prime factorization of `6n`: Combine the prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`, considering that `6n` includes both the prime factors of `2n` and `3n` with possibly increased powers.
4. Calculate the number of divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor counting formula (product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor) to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude that `6n` has 35 divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to show that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.75
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes raised to powers is the product of one plus each of those powers. This is due to the divisor function's multiplicative property.
2. Factorize $2n$ and $3n$: Given the number of divisors, deduce possible prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$. This involves understanding that the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ relates to their number of divisors.
3. Determine Common and Unique Prime Factors: Analyze the prime factorizations to identify common factors between $2n$ and $3n$, and factors unique to each. This is crucial for understanding how $6n$'s factorization will differ.
4. Construct $6n$'s Prime Factorization: Use the information about common and unique factors to deduce $6n$'s prime factorization. This step involves combining the unique factors of $2n$ and $3n$ with the doubled prime factor from multiplying by $6$.
5. Calculate $6n$'s Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function property to $6n$'s prime factorization to calculate the number of divisors. This is a direct application of the multiplicative property of the divisor function.
6. Conclude that $6n$ has 35 Divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to confirm that $6n$ indeed has 35 divisors, completing the proof.

======= High-Level Plans and UCB Values =======
Plan 0 UCB Value: 0.98
1. Prime Factorization: Begin by considering the prime factorization of \(n\), \(2n\), and \(3n\). The number of divisors a number has is related to the exponents in its prime factorization.
2. Use Given Information: Apply the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to infer possible exponents in the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\).
3. Determine Exponents for \(6n\): Since \(6n = 2 \times 3 \times n\), combine the inferred exponents from \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce the prime factorization of \(6n\).
4. Calculate Divisors of \(6n\): Use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization of \(6n\) to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude the Proof: Show that the number of divisors of \(6n\) matches the given number (35) by comparing it with the calculated number from the previous step.

Plan 1 UCB Value: 0.96
1. Understand the Divisor Function: Recognize that the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \(N\) has the prime factorization \(N = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}\), then the number of divisors of \(N\) is given by \((k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)\).

2. Prime Factorization Analysis: Analyze the prime factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\). Since \(2n\) and \(3n\) share the factor \(n\), their prime factorizations will be closely related. The prime factorization of \(6n\) will combine those of \(2n\) and \(3n\) with an additional factor of \(2\) and \(3\), respectively.

3. Deduce the Prime Factorization of \(n\): Use the given information about the number of divisors of \(2n\) and \(3n\) to deduce constraints on the prime factorization of \(n\). This step may involve reasoning about how the prime factorization of \(n\) must adjust to accommodate the counts of 28 and 30 divisors for \(2n\) and \(3n\), respectively.

4. Calculate the Number of Divisors of \(6n\): Once the prime factorization of \(n\) is understood, calculate the prime factorization of \(6n\) by appropriately combining and adjusting the factorizations of \(2n\) and \(3n\), and then applying the divisor function formula to find the number of divisors of \(6n\).

5. Conclude with the Desired Result: Use the calculated number of divisors of \(6n\) to conclude that it must be 35, as per the given condition. This conclusion will likely involve verifying that the adjustments made to the prime factorization of \(n\) to account for the divisor counts of \(2n\) and \(3n\) indeed lead to a divisor count of 35 for \(6n\).

Plan 2 UCB Value: 0.96
1. Use the properties of divisors: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes can be found by multiplying the number of divisors of each prime factor raised to their respective powers plus one.
2. Factorize `2n` and `3n`: Since `2n` and `3n` are given to have a specific number of divisors, use their prime factorization to deduce the possible prime factors and their powers in `n`.
3. Deduce the prime factorization of `6n`: Combine the prime factorizations of `2n` and `3n` to deduce the prime factorization of `6n`, considering that `6n` includes both the prime factors of `2n` and `3n` with possibly increased powers.
4. Calculate the number of divisors of `6n`: Apply the divisor counting formula (product of `(exponent + 1)` for each prime factor) to the prime factorization of `6n` to calculate the total number of divisors.
5. Conclude that `6n` has 35 divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to show that `Finset.card (Nat.divisors (6 * n)) = 35`.

Plan 3 UCB Value: 1.69
1. Understand Divisor Function Properties: Recognize that the number of divisors of a product of primes raised to powers is the product of one plus each of those powers. This is due to the divisor function's multiplicative property.
2. Factorize $2n$ and $3n$: Given the number of divisors, deduce possible prime factorizations of $2n$ and $3n$. This involves understanding that the prime factorization of $2n$ and $3n$ relates to their number of divisors.
3. Determine Common and Unique Prime Factors: Analyze the prime factorizations to identify common factors between $2n$ and $3n$, and factors unique to each. This is crucial for understanding how $6n$'s factorization will differ.
4. Construct $6n$'s Prime Factorization: Use the information about common and unique factors to deduce $6n$'s prime factorization. This step involves combining the unique factors of $2n$ and $3n$ with the doubled prime factor from multiplying by $6$.
5. Calculate $6n$'s Number of Divisors: Apply the divisor function property to $6n$'s prime factorization to calculate the number of divisors. This is a direct application of the multiplicative property of the divisor function.
6. Conclude that $6n$ has 35 Divisors: Use the calculated number of divisors to confirm that $6n$ indeed has 35 divisors, completing the proof.
