1. Specialize the given property: Use the property `v = 1 / 3 * (b * h)` for specific values of `b` and `h`. Specifically, specialize it for `b = 30` and `h = 13 / 2`, ensuring both `b` and `h` are positive.
2. Justify the choice of `b` and `h`: Use `linarith` to prove that the chosen values of `b = 30` and `h = 13 / 2` satisfy the conditions (i.e., both are greater than 0).
3. Rewrite the expression for `v`: Recognize that `v` can be expressed as `1 / 3 * (30 * (13 / 2))`. Use `congr` and `norm_num` to simplify and establish this equality.
4. Apply the specialized property: Substitute the expression for `v` with `1 / 3 * (30 * (13 / 2))` using the property `v = 1 / 3 * (b * h)` that was specialized earlier.
5. Simplify to find `v`: Use `norm_num` to simplify the arithmetic expression `1 / 3 * (30 * (13 / 2))` to the final answer `65`.
